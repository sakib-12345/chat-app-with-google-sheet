## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Google Sheets (gspread)**

## 📊 Database Setup
- **Step 1:** Create a Google sheet.
- **Step 2:** There will be three different sheet named users, messeges and banned.
- **Step 3:** Columns must be:
  - users: **| username | password | role |**
  - messeges: **| username | role | content | timestamp |**
  - banned: **| username |**
- EDITIONAL STEP :You have to replace the *SPREADSHEET_ID* variable id  with your sheet id.(Line 10 in chat.py file)

> you can find the id from url.Then, copy this area:
```python
    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE>/edit#gid=0
```
> Paste it there(you will find the variable in line 10 in chat.py file)
```python
    SPREADSHEET_ID = "<YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE>"
```
- **Step 4:** Add google service account email in the sheet(as a editor)    
- **Step 5:** Copy the API configuration file and convert it into a TOML-style format. Keep this file strictly confidential.
- **Step 6:** Use the file as your environment variable configuration.
- **Step 7:** Deploy the application to any Python-compatible server.


"IN MY CASE, I USE STREAMLIT FREE SERVER AND PASTE THE API KEY IN STREAMLIT SECRETS."
